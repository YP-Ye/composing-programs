# Chapter 2: Building Abstractions with Data

## 2.1 Introduction

On *non-numeric types*: note that, under the covers, everything is "numeric".
Values like `True` and `False` will have specific numeric equivalents (e.g.
1 and 0), whereas strings like `"Hello, World!"` are represented as
sequences of bytes.

## 2.2 Data Abstraction

*"Functions are sufficient to represent compound data."*

Note the other preconditions: first-order functions and closures.
